She walks each day with quiet strength,
carrying hopes she rarely speaks.
She tries her best through every test,
even when her tired heart feels weak, gently.

And when the world feels far too heavy,
she quietly lifts her gaze gently instead of giving in,
trusting God with every step,
letting His grace steady her again, gently.


Today is Earth day.
I love Earth day.
